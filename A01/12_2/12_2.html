        The HyperText Markup Language or<ins>HTML</ins> is the standard markup
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
        defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted
        by technologies such as<b style="color: white"
          >Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b
        >
        and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
        documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
        web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
        as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and
        surround and provide information about document text and may include
        sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
        interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a
        scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout
        of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
        the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
        use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of
        HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
        using the element, together with JavaScript. <br /><br />

      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of
      1990, Berners-Lee listed<b style="color: white"
        >"some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"</b
      >; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4] The first publicly available
      description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned
      on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18
      elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except
      for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an
      in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation
      format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8] HTML is
      a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text,
      images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default
      characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
      and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
      designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned
      in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
      describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that
      used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
      (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting
      commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
      format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based
      on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely
      print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
      progressively moved in this direction with CSS. Berners-Lee considered
      HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
      Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of
      the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
      Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which
      included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The
      draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of
      the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
      reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful
      prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+
      (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
      already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
