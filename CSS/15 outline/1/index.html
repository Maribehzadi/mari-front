        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
        including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
        content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
        to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
        and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
        between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
