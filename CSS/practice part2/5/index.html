            In the 21st century, a virus wiped out most of humanity. Fewer than
            two million people survived, and all their descendants have lost
            their sense of sight. See takes place several centuries later, by
            which time society has found new ways to socially interact, build,
            hunt, and survive without vision, albeit at a much lower economic
            level;[3] humanity has returned to tribal hunter-gatherer and
            medieval-type societies. Knowledge of the old, sighted world has
            become lost or distorted; it is believed that materials such as
            metal, concrete, and plastic were created supernaturally by gods.
