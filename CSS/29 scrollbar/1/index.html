        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
        MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
        Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the
        separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content
        also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
        styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by
        voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
        tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
        content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from
        the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
        more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority
        scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the
        World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
        text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The
        W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5] In
        addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
        including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK
        widget toolkit. CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October
        1994.[23] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[24]
        Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the
        same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide
        Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25]
        being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was
        influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator
        of CSS.[26] Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the
        beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s,
        and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[27] One
        requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come
        from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet
        languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand,
        let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of
        "cascading" styles.[27] As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider
        variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers.
        This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at
        the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser
        implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[28] made consistent
        site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web
        content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee
        had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets
        could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[24] Robert
        Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the
        presentation so that different style sheets could describe different
        presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[28]
        Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many
        in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were
        proposed on the www-style mailing list.[27] Of these nine proposals, two
        were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style
        Sheets[23] and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[26][29] Two
        browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with
        Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[30][31][32]
        Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[26]
        Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the
        'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be
        applied to other markup languages besides HTML).[24] Lie's proposal was
        presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in
        Chicago, Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[24] Around
        this time the W3C was already being established and took an interest in
        the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired
        by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the
        deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were
        the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with
        additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating
        as well. In August 1996, Netscape Communication Corporation presented an
        alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets
        (JSSS).[24] The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.[33] By the
        end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1
        Recommendation was published in December. Development of HTML, CSS, and
        the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial
        Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working
        groups: HTML Working Group, chaired by Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working
        group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working Group,
        chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C. The CSS Working Group began tackling
        issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the
        creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C
        Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998,
        is still under development as of 2014. In 2005, the CSS Working Groups
        decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This
        meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors,
        and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working
        Draft level. The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's
        Internet Explorer 3[24] was released that year, featuring some limited
        support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was
        typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being
        usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser
        achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet
        Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was the first
        browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1 support,[34]
        surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of
        CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon
        afterward, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.
        However, even when later "version 5" web browsers began to offer a
        fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain
        areas. They were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs, and other quirks.
        Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. x for Windows, as opposed to the very
        different IE for Macintosh, had a flawed implementation of the CSS box
        model, as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and
        variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve
        a consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of
        workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box model bugs
        were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft
        introduced a backward-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ("quirks
        mode") alongside an alternative, corrected "standards mode". Other
        non-Microsoft browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It,
        therefore, became necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they
        contained special distinctive "standards-compliant CSS intended" marker
        to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly, in
        compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now
        long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers
        with the "quirks mode"-switching capability will size objects in web
        pages as IE 5 on Windows would, rather than following CSS standards.
        Problems with the patchy adoption of CSS and errata in the original
        specification led the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standards into CSS 2.1,
        which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML
        browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented
        were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to
        bring the standard into line with the predominant existing
        implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February
        25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June
        13, 2005,[35] and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on
        July 19, 2007.[36]
