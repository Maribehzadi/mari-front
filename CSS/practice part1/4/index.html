        The ocean moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the
        water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. The surface of water interacts with
        the atmosphere, exchanging properties such as particles and temperature,
        as well as currents. Surface currents are the water currents that are
        produced by the atmosphere's currents and its winds blowing over the
        surface of the water, producing wind waves, setting up through drag slow
        but stable circulations of water, as in the case of the ocean sustaining
        deep-sea ocean currents. Deep-sea currents, known together as the global
        conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean and
        significantly influence Earth's climate. Tides, the generally
        twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation
        and the gravitational effects of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, of
        the Sun.

        The salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface
        and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean;
        however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across
        the oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium
        chloride. The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium,
        potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute
        concentrations.

        A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae,
        plants, fungi, and animals, lives in the seas, which offers a wide range
        of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit
        surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold,
        dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice
        caps to the warm waters of coral reefs in tropical regions. Many of the
        major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started
        there.
