        <h1>Ocean</h1>
        <p>
          The ocean (also known as the sea or the world ocean) is a body of salt
          water that covers approximately 70.8% of the Earth and contains 97% of
          Earth's water.[9] The term ocean also refers to any of the large
          bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally
          divided.[10] Distinct names are used to identify five different areas
          of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian,
          Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest).[11][12] Seawater covers
          approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The
          ocean is the primary component of the Earth's hydrosphere, and thus
          essential to life on Earth. The ocean influences climate and weather
          patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge
          heat reservoir.
